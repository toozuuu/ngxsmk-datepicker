## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/updates

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration changes (GitHub Actions workflows)

Example:
```
feat: add keyboard navigation support
fix: resolve date range selection issue
docs: update README with SSR examples
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main` or `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
4. Ensure the build succeeds: `npm run build:optimized`
   - This automatically removes source maps from production builds
   - Use `npm run build:analyze` to check bundle size
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Create a pull request with a clear description

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build:optimized`)
- [ ] Bundle size checked (`npm run build:analyze`)
- [ ] Linter passes (if configured)

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Angular

- Use standalone components
- Prefer `inject()` over constructor injection
- Use `OnPush` change detection strategy
- Guard browser-only APIs with platform checks

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Test SSR compatibility when applicable

## Public API Guidelines

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require:
1. Major version bump (semver)
2. Migration guide in `MIGRATION.md`
3. Clear documentation in CHANGELOG.md
4. Deprecation notice (if applicable) in previous version

### Adding New Features

1. Update `public-api.ts` if exporting new types/components
2. Add tests
3. Update README.md with examples
4. Add JSDoc comments

### Deprecation Policy

We follow a clear deprecation strategy to ensure smooth upgrades:

- **Deprecation Period**: Deprecated features remain available for at least **2 major versions** before removal
- **Deprecation Warnings**: 
  - `@deprecated` JSDoc tags in code
  - Console warnings in development mode (when applicable)
  - Clear documentation in CHANGELOG.md
- **Migration Path**: 
  - Migration guides provided in `MIGRATION.md`
  - Code examples for upgrading
  - Alternative APIs documented
- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - Only occur in major version releases
  - Clearly documented in CHANGELOG.md
  - Migration guides provided for all breaking changes

#### Example Deprecation Process

1. **Version X.0.0**: Feature marked as deprecated with `@deprecated` tag
2. **Version X+1.0.0**: Feature still available, deprecation warnings continue
3. **Version X+2.0.0**: Feature removed, breaking change documented

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (library + demo app)
npm test

# Run library tests only
npx ng test ngxsmk-datepicker --no-watch --browsers=ChromeHeadless

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npx ng test ngxsmk-datepicker --include="**/issue-13.spec.ts"
```

**Note**: The library tests require Zone.js polyfills, which are automatically configured in `angular.json`. If tests fail, ensure the test configuration includes the polyfills.

**Test Status**: All 353+ tests should pass. The test suite covers:
- Component functionality and edge cases
- Utility functions (date, calendar, timezone, performance)
- RTL support and locale detection
- Touch gestures and swipe handling
- Calendar views (year, decade, timeline, time-slider)
- Recurring dates and pattern matching
- SSR compatibility
- Keyboard navigation

### Writing Tests

- Use Jasmine/Karma
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Test SSR compatibility when applicable
- Test accessibility features
- Ensure tests work with OnPush change detection
- Test zone-less operation when applicable
- Use `.toEqual()` instead of `.toBe()` for Date objects and arrays
- Properly mock browser APIs (TouchEvent, document.dir) when testing
- Ensure change detection is called with `fixture.detectChanges()` where needed
- Verify component state after initialization before testing interactions

## Documentation

### README Updates

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update compatibility table if needed

### API Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document parameters and return types
- Include usage examples in comments

## Build and Bundle Optimization

### Build Scripts

- `npm run build` - Development build
- `npm run build:optimized` - Production build with optimizations:
  - Removes source maps automatically
  - Optimized TypeScript compilation
  - Enhanced tree-shaking
- `npm run build:analyze` - Analyze bundle size (excludes source maps)

### Bundle Size Guidelines

- Main bundle target: ~127KB (excluding source maps)
- Source maps are automatically excluded from published package
- Use `npm run build:analyze` to verify bundle size before PR

## Release Process

The npm package **`ngxsmk-datepicker`** is published from `dist/ngxsmk-datepicker` after an `ng-packagr` production build. The `dist/` folder is **not** committed (`/dist` is gitignored), so publishing without building produces broken tarballs (see [issue #230](https://github.com/NGXSMK/ngxsmk-datepicker/issues/230)).

### Automated (recommended)

1. Merge release-worthy commits to `main` using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (semantic-release uses them for versioning).
2. Ensure the repository has an **`NPM_TOKEN`** secret (npm Automation token).
3. The [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs `semantic-release`, which **builds the library in `prepare`** then publishes from `dist/ngxsmk-datepicker`.

### Manual publish

1. Run tests: `npm test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless`
2. Run `npm run publish:patch` (or `publish:beta`) — this runs `build:optimized`, copies root docs into `dist/ngxsmk-datepicker`, then `npm publish` from that directory.

Do **not** run `npm publish` from the workspace root (that package is `ngxsmk-datepicker-workspace`, not the library). Do **not** publish from `dist/ngxsmk-datepicker` unless you have just run `npm run build:optimized && npm run prepublish:copy-assets` and `node scripts/assert-dist-lib-ready.cjs` succeeds.
