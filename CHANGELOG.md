# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Last updated:** March 9, 2026 · **Current stable:** v2.2.3

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.3] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Linting**: Resolved SonarLint cognitive complexity and nesting depth issues in Material support integration.
- **Coverage**: Increased function test coverage to ~68.2% to meet project thresholds.
- **Stability**: Fixed regression in touch event handling and Material Form Field integration.
- **Maintenance**: Marked static registry as readonly and removed redundant helper methods.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-03

- **Version**: Bump to 2.2.1.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-25

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Fixed text contrast in dropdown options for better accessibility, ensuring high-contrast labels for month and year selections.
- **Web Component Support**: Added capability to export the library as a standard Custom Web Component using Angular Elements, enabling full support for React, Vue, Svelte, and Vanilla JS.
- **Example Applications**: Added React, Vue, and Vanilla JS implementation examples in the `/examples` directory.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript Strictness Overhaul**: Comprehensive rewrite of library component typing to eliminate all `any` types. Ensure full compatibility with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` strict configurations.
  - Corrected `classes` input type from `Record<string, unknown>` to the concrete `DatepickerClasses` interface explicitly allowing `| undefined = undefined` to support strict assignments.
  - Applied specific types everywhere (`Date[]` for timelineMonths, `{label, value: boolean}[]` for ampmOptions, explicit Event and TouchEvent payloads).
  - Adjusted Angular pseudo-event `keydown.enter` handlers expecting `KeyboardEvent` to use the base `Event` type for robust type safety.
- **appendToBody positioning (Issue #206)**: When `appendToBody` is enabled, the calendar popover now positions correctly next to the input. The popover uses viewport coordinates and `position: fixed` so it is no longer misplaced on scrolled pages. Inline styles are applied with `!important` so desktop CSS rules do not override the computed position.
- **Datepicker in modal**: When the datepicker is used inside a modal (or any dialog), the popover no longer flashes in the wrong place on first open. The popover is hidden until positioned and then revealed; modal detection auto-enables `appendToBody`. Demo app Integrations page includes a "Datepicker in a modal" example with `[appendToBody]="true"`.
- **Popover width**: The calendar popover now matches the input width (with a minimum of 280px) when positioning is applied, so the dropdown aligns visually with the trigger.

### Changed

- **Header Select Synchronization**: Migrated `CustomSelectComponent` and `CalendarHeaderComponent` to `ViewEncapsulation.None`. Consolidated all dropdown styles into `_header.scss` to enable seamless global layout control.
- **Improved Dropdown Layout**: Implemented a flexbox-based `justify-content: space-between` layout for Month/Year selectors, ensuring a professional, edge-to-edge gap between text and icons on mobile screens.
- **UI Refinement**: Unified container border radii to 12px for visual consistency, removed unnecessary borders from the popover container, and significantly reduced paddings/margins in the header, calendar grid, and footer for a tighter, more modern look.
- **Performance Optimization**: Further reduced internal calendar opening timers for faster user feedback—Mobile delay reduced from 280ms to 150ms, and Desktop delay reduced to 60ms.
- **Loading time**: Reduced opening/loading delays so the calendar appears sooner—desktop ~80–120ms (was 200–350ms), mobile ~280ms (was 800ms). Click path delay before positioning/reveal reduced from 100ms to 50ms.
- **CSS & Linting (SonarLint)**: Resolved duplicate selectors, commented-out code, duplicate properties in `datepicker.css` for cleaner styles, and resolved all 38 remaining TypeScript library lint warnings.


## [2.1.7] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Google Calendar Integration**: Added full built-in support for syncing and displaying events from Google Calendar.
  - New input `enableGoogleCalendar` (boolean) to toggle the feature directly from the template.
  - New input `googleClientId` (string) to configure the Google OAuth Client ID.
  - New `GoogleCalendarService` responsible for GIS library loading and seamless authentication syncing.
  - Displays authenticated status natively within the calendar header popup.
  - Emits `googleSyncClick` for tracking user interactions.

### Fixed

- **DatePipe Provider Issue**: Fixed `NG0201: No provider found for _DatePipe` error (Issue #193). Decoupled `DatepickerParsingService` from the root injector to ensure it correctly resolves `DatePipe` within the component context. Users no longer need to manually provide `DatePipe` in their application configuration.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- **Version**: Bump to 2.1.6 (current stable release).

## [2.1.5] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Validation messages (i18n)**: New user-facing validation strings in `DatepickerTranslations`—`invalidDateFormat`, `dateBeforeMin`, `dateAfterMax`, `invalidDate`—with full translation support across all 8 languages. The component shows a translated error message when input is invalid, before min, or after max, and emits `validationError` with `code` and `message`.
- **Calendar loading state**: Visual loading state (spinner + text) while the calendar is opening or generating. Loading state is announced to screen readers via `AriaLiveService`. A public getter is available for templates to reflect "calendar is loading."
- **Installation options**: New `docs/INSTALLATION.md` documenting all install methods (npm, Yarn, pnpm, Bun, Git, local path, CDN, tarball). Demo Installation page updated with alternative install commands and a link to the full guide.
- **Issue-reproduction app**: New minimal Angular app `angular-issue-test` (routes: Home, month-navigation, range-reselection) for manually verifying reported issues. Served via `npx ng serve angular-issue-test`.

### Changed

- **Version**: Bump to 2.1.5 (stable release).
- **Demo app – light/dark theme**: Theme toggle now correctly switches the UI. `data-theme` is synced on the document when theme changes; `html[data-theme='light']` CSS overrides added for the light palette. Nav-link hover uses `var(--color-text-main)` for both themes. Responsive spacing variables use `clamp()`.
- **Library refactors**: Calendar grid generation and input parsing/formatting logic extracted into `CalendarGenerationService` and `DatepickerParsingService` respectively.
- **Demo styles**: New utility classes (e.g. `.link`, `.no-underline`, `.text-dim`, `.gap-xs`) and tip label layout tweak.
- **Docs**: README and library README reference `docs/INSTALLATION.md`. CHANGELOG, MIGRATION, ROADMAP, SECURITY, API_REFERENCE, BUNDLE_SIZE_REPORT, and API.md updated for 2.1.5.

### Fixed

- **Demo theme**: Fixed light/dark theme toggle not applying—demo now correctly reflects the active theme (header toggle and system preference).

## [2.1.4] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Playground Enhancements**: Added new configuration options for `minDate`, `maxDate`, and `weekStart` to the interactive playground, allowing users to test boundary constraints and locale overrides.
- **Improved Internationalization**: Added full translation support for new playground features across all 8 supported languages (English, German, Spanish, Swedish, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and French).

### Fixed

- **Calendar Grid Consistency**: Ensured the calendar always generates a full 42-day (6-week) grid. This prevents layout shifts and provides a more stable UI when navigating between months with different numbers of days.
- **Locale-Specific Week Starts**: Fixed issues with manual `weekStart` overrides and locale-dependent first day of week calculations, ensuring accurate calendar generation across diverse cultural settings.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Inline Datepicker Width**: Fixed an issue where the inline datepicker was constrained by container styles in some contexts, causing it to appear cramped or cut off. The inline mode now correctly fits its content.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Mobile Experience**: Improved stability on mobile devices (specifically Samsung/Android/Edge).
  - Fixed an issue where the calendar would close prematurely during interactions due to portaling logic.
  - Added "ghost click" protection to the backdrop to prevent accidental closure right after opening.
  - Standardized containment checks to handle popovers appended to the document body.
- **Circular Dependency**: Resolved `RuntimeError: NG0200: Circular dependency detected` when using `NgModel` or Reactive Forms.
  - Removed `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` from component providers to break the circular link with `NgControl`.
  - Implemented manual `valueAccessor` assignment in the constructor for safe interaction with Angular's form system.
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed unused `forwardRef` and `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR` imports to improve bundle size and build performance.

### Changed

- **UI Refinement (Premium Aesthetic)**: Improved the overall visual appearance with a "border detox."
  - Reduced border thickness from 1.5px to 1px library-wide.
  - Softened border colors and added subtle ghost backgrounds for interactive elements.
  - Enhanced navigation buttons with a borderless-by-default look.

### Removed

- **Range Duration Header**: Removed the "X Days" duration header from range selection mode to reduce visual clutter and simplify the UI.


## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Material Form Field Integration**: Improved `NgxsmkDatepickerComponent` to correctly notify `mat-form-field` of state changes.
  - Injected `NgControl` into the component to properly integrate with Angular's form system.
  - Added `stateChanges.next()` call in `emitValue` to ensure the form field reflects internal state changes (e.g., when selecting a date).
- **Helper Function Enhancements**: Updated `provideMaterialFormFieldControl` with runtime warnings for missing or incorrect Material tokens.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-05


### Fixed

- **Package Configuration**: Corrected TypeScript declaration paths in package.json
  - Updated `types` and `typings` fields to point to `types/ngxsmk-datepicker.d.ts` instead of non-existent `index.d.ts`

## [2.0.7] - 2026-01-26

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.7

## [2.0.6] - 2026-01-15

### Enhanced

- **Range Picker Reselection**: Improved comprehensive range reselection behavior
  - Clicking the start date when a complete range is selected now clears only the end date
  - Clicking the end date when a complete range is selected now clears the start date and sets the end date as the new start date
  - **NEW**: Clicking any date within the selected range now clears the end date and sets the clicked date as the new start date
  - Allows users to easily redefine date ranges from any point (start, end, or within the range)
  - Example scenarios:
    - Range: Jan 10 - Jan 20, Click Jan 10 → Result: Jan 10 (can select new end)
    - Range: Jan 10 - Jan 20, Click Jan 20 → Result: Jan 20 (can select new end)
    - Range: Jan 26 - Jan 30, Click Jan 27 → Result: Jan 27 (can select new end)
  - Improves usability by providing intuitive range adjustment from any direction

### Changed

- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary inline comments from range selection logic for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.6

## [2.0.5] - 2026-01-15

### Enhanced

- **Range Picker Reselection**: Improved user experience when reselecting date ranges
  - Clicking the start date again after selecting a complete range now clears only the end date
  - Allows users to easily redefine the end date without clearing the entire selection
  - The start date remains selected, and users can immediately choose a new end date
  - Example: After selecting Jan 19 (start) → Jan 21 (end), clicking Jan 19 again keeps Jan 19 selected and clears Jan 21
  - Improves usability by reducing clicks needed to adjust date ranges

### Fixed

- **Range Mode Value Emission**: Fixed issue where clicking the start date again after a complete range was selected would update the visual state but not emit the value change
  - The datepicker now properly emits a partial range value (`{ start: Date, end: null }`) when the end date is cleared
  - Parent components and form bindings now correctly reflect the cleared end date state
  - Resolves inconsistency between visual calendar state and bound values

### Patch Changes

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.5
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive "Form Validation" section to README to explain `readonly` input behavior and provide solutions for native browser validation (e.g., using `allowTyping="true"`).

## [2.0.4] - 2026-01-14

### Patch Changes

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.4
- **Validation Fix**: Fixed issue where `[field]` validation messages were not triggering because the `touched` state was not being synced to the field. Added `markAsTouched` support to `FieldSyncService` and updated `NgxsmkDatepickerComponent` to mark the field as touched on blur and value selection.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-14

### Patch Changes

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.3
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary comments from `field-sync.service.ts` to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Bug Fixed**: Verified fixes for issues #136, #112, #84, and #71.
- **TypeScript Compatibility**: Fixed `SignalFormField` and `SignalFormFieldConfig` types to be fully compatible with Angular 21+ `FieldTree<string | Date | null, string>` structure. The types now accept `WritableSignal<string | Date | null>` from Angular's Signal Forms, resolving TypeScript compilation errors when using `[field]` binding.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-14

### Patch Changes

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 2.0.2

## [1.9.29] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **Angular Signal Forms Validation Support**: Full support for schema-based validation with Angular 21+ Signal Forms
  - Automatically detects and responds to validation errors from the field's `errors()` signal
  - Recognizes `required` validation from schema (e.g., `required(p.dateDue)`)
  - Updates component's `errorState` based on field's `invalid()` signal
  - Reactive updates when validation state changes
  - Resolves [#136](https://github.com/NGXSMK/ngxsmk-datepicker/issues/136) - "datepicker doesn't recognise 'required' attribute in schema"
- **Validation Error Types**: Added `ValidationError` interface to support Angular Signal Forms error structure
- **Error State Callback**: Added `onErrorStateChanged` callback to `FieldSyncCallbacks` for validation state tracking
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added `docs/SIGNAL_FORMS_VALIDATION.md` with usage examples, API reference, and migration guide
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite in `signal-forms-validation.spec.ts` for validation scenarios
- **Input Attributes Support**: Added support for standard input attributes on the datepicker input element
  - `inputId`: Custom ID support (defaults to component unique ID)
  - `name`: Form name attribute support
  - `autocomplete`: Autocomplete attribute support (defaults to 'off')
  - `aria-invalid`: Accessibility support for invalid state visibility
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help Dialog**: Added a built-in help dialog for keyboard shortcuts, accessible via `?` or `Shift + /`.
- **New Shortcut**: Added `?` keyboard shortcut to toggle the help dialog.

### Enhanced

- **Field Sync Service**: Enhanced with new helper methods
  - `readFieldErrors()`: Reads validation errors from field's `errors` signal
  - `readRequiredState()`: Checks for required validation in errors or direct property (prioritizes schema validation)
  - `hasValidationErrors()`: Determines if field has any validation errors
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with:
  - Direct `required` attribute: `<ngxsmk-datepicker required>`
  - Reactive Forms: `<ngxsmk-datepicker [formControl]="dateControl">`
  - Template-driven forms: `<ngxsmk-datepicker [(ngModel)]="date">`
  - Direct `required` property on field: `field.required = true`

### Fixed

- **Header Layout**: Fixed CSS issue where the datepicker header width was not spanning the full container width, ensuring consistent layout across all screen sizes.
- **Angular Signal Forms Schema Validation**: Fixed issue where `required` attribute from schema was not properly reflected on the input and form validation
- **Month Navigation**: Fixed a critical bug where navigating to the next month would skip a month (e.g., Jan -> Mar) if the current date was the 31st (due to JS Date overflow). Navigation now correctly calculates from the start of the month.
- **Signal Forms Integration**: Critical fix for `[field]` binding where Signal fields (passed as functions) were being ignored, preventing validation metadata (like `.required`) from being read.
- **Range Navigation**: Fixed usability issue where selecting an end date in a different month would unexpectedly reset the calendar view back to the start date's month, causing confusion.
- **Field Sync Service**: Updated `readRequiredState` and `readDisabledState` to correctly process function-type fields (Signals).

### Changed

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 1.9.29

## [1.9.27] - 2026-01-10

### Refactored

- **Modern Control Flow**: Fully migrated all standalone components (`NgxsmkDatepickerComponent`, `CalendarHeaderComponent`, `CalendarMonthViewComponent`, `CalendarYearViewComponent`, `TimeSelectionComponent`, `CustomSelectComponent`) to modern Angular `@if` and `@for` block syntax.
- **Optimized Imports**: Replaced monolithic `CommonModule` with individual directive and pipe imports (`NgClass`, `NgTemplateOutlet`, `DatePipe`) in all standalone components. This improves tree-shaking and resolves resolution conflicts in some environments.

### Fixed

- **Module Resolution**: Resolved "Value could not be determined statically" error when importing standalone library components into traditional NgModules in some monorepo configurations.
- **Build Process**: Fixed library compilation error (`TS6133`) caused by unused `CommonModule` after migration to modern control flow.
- **Monorepo Compatibility**: Improved Angular core dependency resolution for example applications to prevent "duplicate symbol" and "exported symbol not found" errors during development.

### Maintenance

- **Git**: Added `/examples` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent committing experimental test applications.

### Changed

- **Version Update**: Updated to version 1.9.27

## [1.9.26] - 2026-01-09
