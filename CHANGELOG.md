- **Date Clicks After Month Navigation**: Fixed issue where dates became unclickable after navigating backward or forward months
  - Updated `isDateDisabledMemo` getter to properly invalidate cached memoized function when month/year changes
  - Added month/year change detection to ensure disabled date cache is refreshed after navigation
  - Dates in previous/next months are now properly clickable without needing to close and reopen the datepicker

- All fixes are backward compatible
- Compatible with Angular 17 and up versions

## [1.9.14] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Date Picker Selection Issue**: Fixed issue where date picker was not working properly when selecting dates, especially in range mode

  - Fixed UI not updating when only start date is selected in range mode
  - Dates now properly show as selected and calendar updates correctly in all selection modes
- **Moment.js Timezone Offset Preservation**: Fixed issue where Moment.js objects with timezone offsets (e.g., `moment().utcOffset('-0600')`) were not preserving the timezone offset when converted to Date objects
  - Added `momentToDate()` method that detects and preserves timezone offsets from Moment.js objects
  - Uses moment's `format('YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ')` to preserve offset information
  - Now correctly handles `moment().utcOffset('-0600')` without requiring `toDate()` which loses timezone information
